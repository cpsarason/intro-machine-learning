## About me:
Hello I'm [Sage Elliott](http://sageelliott.com/). I'm a Technology Evangelist at Galvanize Seattle. Previously I've worked as a software and hardware engineer with Startups and Agencies in Seattle, WA and Melbourne, FL. I love technology! Currently learning more about Deep Learning and Computer Vision(Can't wait to do a workshop on it)!

*caveat* I'm not an Galvanize instructor, they're much better at teaching than I am! :D

If you have an event you would like to see or put on let me know! I'm always looking for ideas. Talk to me after the workshop or find me online at one of these:

## The Break Down:

Talking about things like AI and Selfdriving cars sounds like Machine Learning is crazy complicated! And although these problems cleary can be, you can absoluetly learn how to become a Machine Learning Engineer! 

Lets take a look at a breakdown of a machine learning algorith together!

#### The Model

#### Probability


### Types of Machine Learning

### Supervised:

##### Classification:
Tries to categorize data.

##### Regression:
Tries to predict a quantity or a number


### Unsupervised Learning
- clustering 


## Lets make something with Machine learning!

## Keep learning!
