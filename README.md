## About me:
Hello I'm [Sage Elliott](http://sageelliott.com/). I'm a Technology Evangelist at Galvanize Seattle. Previously I've worked as a software and hardware engineer with Startups and Agencies in Seattle, WA and Melbourne, FL. I love technology! I'm currently learning more about how to build AI and VR projects (I can't wait to do a workshop round these topics)! 

*caveat* I'm not an Galvanize instructor, they're much better at teaching than I am! :D

If you have an event you would like to see or put on let me know! I'm always looking for ideas. Talk to me after the workshop or find me online at one of these:
